Chip Senkbeil's Resume
======================

The following contains my resume, now split between my academic and industrial
experiences. Both were written in LaTeX that I came up with (inspired 
somewhere) sophomore year.

Academic
--------

This focuses on my years at Virginia Tech as a _computer science_ and
_computer engineering_ dual-degree undergraduate.

The time period was 2009-2013.

Work
----

This focuses on my work in the industry. Currently, it only contains my work
at _IBM_ since that is the only job I have held since academia.

The time period is 2014.
